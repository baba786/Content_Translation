# Content Translation Interface Usability Test

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in this usability test. We're testing a prototype for a content translation interface that helps Wikipedia editors find articles to translate. This is a **prototype only**, so some functionality may be limited.

**Test Duration:** 10-15 minutes

You will be testing two different design versions (Design A and Design B) of the same interface to help us understand which works better. The main difference is in how filtering options appear when you click "More".

## Test Links

- [Design A](https://baba786.github.io/Content_Translation/) - The sidebar design
- [Design B](https://baba786.github.io/Content_Translation/dev/) - The inline design

Please complete all tasks on both designs if possible.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Filtering Content
1. Open either design (A or B)
2. Look at the current article suggestions
3. Click the "More" button (with the three dots)
4. Find and select "Literature" from the topics section
5. Click "Done" to apply the filter

### Task 2: Exploring Categories
1. Click the "More" button again
2. Look at the different tabs (All, Collections, Regions, Topics)
3. Click on the "Regions" tab
4. Select any country from the Europe region
5. Click "Done" to apply the filter

### Task 3: Starting a Translation
1. Imagine you want to start a new translation
2. Find and click the "New translation" button
3. (Note: This is just a prototype, so nothing will happen after clicking)

## Questions

After completing the tasks on both designs, please answer these questions:

1. **Ease of Use:** Which design (A or B) was easier to use when filtering content, and why?

2. **Visibility:** In which design was it easier to see the available filtering options? Why?

3. **Layout Preference:** Design A shows the filter panel as a sidebar, while Design B shows it inline (pushing content down). Which approach do you prefer and why?

4. **Button Placement:** Did you notice that the "New translation" button is in different locations in each design? Which location felt more intuitive?

5. **Overall Preference:** If you had to choose one design to use regularly, which would you choose (A or B) and why?
